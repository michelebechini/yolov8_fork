- to modify OKS sigmas remember to update both metrics/loss and valid.py in pose folder
- to return to the old version of mosaic augmentation images modify the buffer to False in augment.py 
  in get_indexes() header (line 141) such that the images are randomly selected from the full dataset
  and not only from the buffer


- AUGMENTATION TESTS

1) standard augmentations (mosaic, random blur, random gaussian noise, random brightness)
      -> 20230622_speed_pose_yolov8s_mixed_imgs_noise
      (mosaico applicato al 100% delle immagini, come random blur e random gaussian noise, random bright con probabilità del 50%)

2) As in Case 1, but with addition of sensor noise (it incorporates blur and random noises only)
      -> 20230710_speed_pose_yolov8s_mixed_imgs_sensor_noise
      (sensor noise applicato al 100% delle immagini, mosaico 100%)

3) As in case 2, but addiction of blooming, row_noise, RandomSunflare (modified) [ADDED to the code]
      -> TODO
      (sensor noise applicato al 100% delle immagini, mosaico 100%, il resto con 50% di probabilità)

3bis) TBD As in case 3 but with dropout (modified)

4) As in case 3, but addiction of style_augmentation (see git philipjackson/style-augmentation)
      -> TODO
      (sensor noise applicato al 100% delle immagini, mosaico 100%, il resto con 50% di probabilità)

Compare the results and the score using the images in SPEED+ lightbox and sunlamp to measure metrics
Include also a comparison using the synthetic images
The images in the validation set are not augmented at the moment (maybe augment also them)
